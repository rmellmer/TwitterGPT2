@syndisparklex 🤷🏻‍♂️ it’s a next to no recognition occupation. DOD members AND their families are warriors for what they give up.

@ChrisO2_ @xkaitIin 
Ok, so I get that this is the NBA finals and all... but did they really have to push the bachelorette back a day? I’m really tryina see Jet beat the crap outta Luke P. and hear Hannah testify about Jesus and forgiveness #TheBachelorette
There’s nothing like having extreme nerves before your wedding, jamming out to worship with your groomsmen to try and calm yourself, only for you bride to log into your Spotify account and start playing All Star by smash mouth 🤦🏻‍♂️ @MichaelaMellmer is the one 😂🤵🏻👰🏼
I’m so ready to stop saying “almost” whenever I talk about my brother in law, mother in law, and most importantly, my wife 😩❤️
@zpaulphog Pls explain
@netflix What even😂
My life would be so different if I ran into @MrBeastYT irl, such a good guy that blesses random people
Ground turkey is seriously the realest
The world ain’t ready for 1) the OG M+M, or 2) the OG 3 to tear up p-town 
@jessconte @1DGabrielaa Shoulda flown Alaska 🤷🏻‍♂️

@syndisparklex Welcome back 😂
@zpaulphog Impressionistic art expression has a lot of ups and downs. With rap it seems to be mostly downs 😂
@zpaulphog How new is it?
@Thesupercole Can relate my man, can relate
HIT EM WITH THE OL RAZZLE DAZZLE 
@maliaberland Literally same
All the chills.... 
The amount of #tadmor2k17 references in our wedding is gonna be really nostalgic for all of you who watched michaela and I trip over our feet for each other #MakingHerAMcIntosh
I just PR’d on deadlift listening to “How Beautiful” by Mosaic MSC. It was perfect
Do you store your coffee with...... (trust me, option #4 works and idk why I’m the only person who does it)
“Delusional artists” is the best sub reddit and you can’t change my mind
@MichaelaMellmer @kaaaitlynmarie You’re LYING 😭😂❤️
@ryanmellmer It’s the thought that counts bro 👊🏻
4) @ryanmellmer just added me on YouTube TV so I can watch the blazers game live finally from japan 😩😩 those Mellmer’s are just quality individuals
I wanna get 2k20 so bad just to be blazers. That would be the best
Things that made me happy today
1) I learned that @Dame_Lillard is 6’ 3” so my dreams aren’t totally unreasonable 
2) We’re gonna close on our house soon and it’s exciting 
3) @MichaelaMellmer continues to work her booty off to get us nice adorable furniture and I’m real in love
I love this movie. I will always love this movie. Ugh 
@MeyersLeonard11 rocking peasant clothes today with his cord-earbuds 
SAY IT LOUDER 
@zpaulphog Roberts rebellion was a good thing for Westeros, I think all can agree. I hope that Jon having a stronger claim than dany will convince dany to chill a little, bit we have to see how Cersei is gonna play in with the white walkers and all of this regal mumbo jumbo
@zpaulphog Let me explain a little better; 

Dany vs Theon, Theon is just a butthurt Greyjoy who backstabbed the Starks to try and prove himself to his father. Dany’s situation is a little different, being a Targaryen
@zpaulphog Oof hit me with the counter argument...

I do think her entire conquest to sit on the iron throne is a little extra, but of course if she was reasonable that wouldn’t makefor good TV. 

But her claim to the throne is a solid one, I would choose her over Rob Boratheon (spellcheck)
@zpaulphog Personally not a fan. To each his own 😂 

I never liked his character much anyways. Someone who super imposes their lordship over everyone just isn’t a quality person in my eyes.
@zpaulphog I think brianne’s knighting was a way to give her one last pat on the back before taking her off the list.

Theon can die already, his Reek phase really made him worthless to me
@zpaulphog They surely will not; I was being hyperbolic out of excitement.

I agree with you, Arya isn’t going to kill Theon... it’s hard to say what her agenda is at the moment if you ask me
@zpaulphog Depends on what you define as a “win.” I think that winterfell is going to suffer heavy casualties and whoever remains after the 60-day filmed 82 minute battle will be forced to retreat on the kings road and return to kings landing. Cersei has to come into all of this somehow
@zpaulphog Bruh they’re all dead tho, I can’t wait
Bro IF YOU GOOGLE “THANOS” AND CLICK THE GAUNTLET LOOK WHAT HAPPENS IM SHOOK 
@MichaelaMellmer This was the most nervous day of my life

@_taylor_TJ @StarbucksxQueen I firmly believe that tribalism is the root of all political malice. There’s a lot of good points on both sides; we need to stop focusing on “Democrat this” and “Republican that” and start dealing with “America first” again and then maybe we can start accomplishing things
Harden must feel a lot like @DanielGruchy getting domed with a soccer ball 
@_taylor_TJ @StarbucksxQueen Taylor, your perspective is awesome. 

There’s flaws of logic and conflicts of interest on both sides of the board and the whole thing is just like watching a train wreck

Spent like 2 hours going through old videos on snapchat with michaela and it was one of the best 2 hours I’ve had
Considering how great 2017 was, 2018 was not a good year. 2019? I’ve got high hopes. Coming back to America in May, marrying my best friend in June, and finally going to spend a lot of time with her. 2019 is going to be a good one

@_taylor_TJ I hear that. I think it’s hard for peoooe to realize that sometimes individuals feel loved in different ways. I’ve discovered that recently as I’m sure you have being engaged 😂
@CoryAsbury @Michael__Leto Bruh. People really out here tryina not feel recklessly loved by the most powerful being in the universe lol
@_taylor_TJ If a lady wants to hold a door for me, I’m flattered and say thank you. I would expect the same from any female. I don’t do these things because I think women are less than capable of opening doors; rather I do it out of respect, and in my fiancé’s case, deep love.
@_taylor_TJ While I’m all for women feeling empowered and do not desire anyone to feel degraded, I think feminism more often than not degrades the calling of a man to protect and provide for his woman. At some point you gotta ask yourself what you believe

Daredevil is one of the best shows to ever be released on Netflix EVER. 

The pilot episode for Daredevil is better than literally any filmography in the entire MCU. 

Good luck naming more that 2 shows with better character development.

One year ago today, I proved to myself that I cold become a marine by earning my Eagle, Globe, and Anchor on top of the Reaper as the last event of the Crucible training exercise. It’s been a wild year, and a lot of it has been rough, but being a marine is a special thing. Oorah

@AbdelTammam Weird how someone who’s pro-minority can understand that being white has nothing to do with treating politics like a joke. 

Can we all just understand that generalizing in this way isn’t constructive to identifying actual racism and stopping it pls and thank u
@808pineapples @DannyG559_ @AbdelTammam What’s funny is that’s literally your right, you’ll just reap the consequences. Everytime we fill out a tax form, we voluntarily commit to paying taxes, and it’s our choice to follow laws.

@EdwardIvory You’re right in what you’re saying. I desire the same thing as well. It’s hard doing what I do and hearing about the mass murders that happen back home. I suppose his claim may not be as erroneous as I took it to be. Thank you Ed, I miss you quite a bit.
@MichaelaMellmer @EdwardIvory You always got my back baby 😘
@EdwardIvory was racist when the strategy was used against them, and it’s racist when the strategy was used against me. Instead of reusing these verbal strategies, we should invent new ones that protect, include, point out the good in people and build each other up instead of breaking down.
@EdwardIvory mutual love and respect and understanding for peoples of all religions, races, colors, creeds, and sexual orientation. So to hear that someone could assume that I’M a threat cuz of my skin leads me to believe it’s a racist blanket statement. It...
@EdwardIvory demographic, much like what has happened (I assume) with the gentleman (dont mean to assume gender here but hey I’ll take a stab) in the clip. Much like happens to me when I hear statements regarding white males. I like to think I’m a peacekeeper who desires improvement and...
@EdwardIvory Well said. My thoughts on the matter are as such; yes, the White House has been known to make those types of blanket statements. The use of those statements is wrong, targeting a demographic alone and not the bad behavior is a great way of triggering innocent people of that ...
@EdwardIvory different upbringings, all I’m saying is that it truly is becoming a distraction and we could all make progress and improvement if we focused on love and grace and not blaming people for things that people of their race have done
@EdwardIvory Capable of choosing great things with Gods grace behind us, and bringing the color of our skin into it distracts from the freedom we could all experience from ourselves.

I’m not trying to discount the fact that race exists or that certain races may be more inclined to...
@EdwardIvory Who still think the color of our skin has as big of a sway on our behavior and decisions as our nature and nurture-upbringing does. We’re all broken people, equally fallible, all in need of grace and forgiveness, all want to be understood, all are capable of mistakes, all are....
@EdwardIvory Who still think the color of our skin has as big of a sway on our behavior and decisions as our nature and nurture-upbringing does. We’re all broken people, equally fallible, all in need of grace and forgiveness, all want to be understood, all are capable of mistakes, all are....
@EdwardIvory Which states “all of X are a threat” without giving any real evidence or data to support such a hyperbolic claim. He could’ve stated any demographic and I would’ve called blanket racism regardless of the demographic he mentioned. 

I’m personally getting exhausted with people....
@EdwardIvory Edward, I politely accept. I think the blanket statement “we have to realize the real threat to our country is white men.” I don’t believe the racism lies within the accusation within the assertion that white males are a threat to our country, rather that using an equation.....
@MichaelaMellmer I am and I am not simultaneously 😂
@MichaelaMellmer Over sexualization of culture. The steady decline of any civilization starts with the prioritization of things that truly don’t matter, like the girl featured in the last 3 minutes of Grease
This is the most racist thing I’ve ever heard 
@MichaelaMellmer Arguably some of the most fun I’ve had in a long time 😩❤️

Can we start teaching men to manage their desires and stop making women feel guilty for being made beautiful? And stop making women feel like their only purpose is to be beautiful as well? It’s killing our culture and robbing men of their opportunity to learn self control..

The authorities that exist have been established by God.”
Romans 13:1 NIV

@RussellPickard2 @huskypackmom @Exo14142 @TheLyon0 @ChunAlexandria @JohnBin99156742 @PaulMenzies4 @sjf10161011 @AlishaFruits @realDonaldTrump If you knew anything about the Bible, you would know that God cares a lot about laws, and He cares about us following them. The “laws” that Jesus broke were made up practices by the Pharisees. They were religious and heartless and Jesus changed that.
@RussellPickard2 @huskypackmom @Exo14142 @TheLyon0 @ChunAlexandria @JohnBin99156742 @PaulMenzies4 @sjf10161011 @AlishaFruits @realDonaldTrump Jesus never had an issue paying taxes. He had an issue with people trying to run businesses in God’s temple when people should be worshipping instead.
@huskypackmom @Exo14142 @TheLyon0 @ChunAlexandria @JohnBin99156742 @PaulMenzies4 @sjf10161011 @AlishaFruits @realDonaldTrump He would probably immigrate the legal way cuz he cares about following godly laws, and therefore be let in without any issue.

@therealajar Can I ever say something that’s genuine and heartfelt AND has a little bit to do with politics without a passive aggressive subtweet from you? This is getting really old.
Those who have fallen before us will never be forgotten. Never forget that waking up every morning is a privilege that has been bought with blood; that of Jesus, and that of the unsung heroes.  #MemorialDay18

@TheEvilWithin So so so SO pumped
Why can't the soprano get into the house? She doesn't know where to come in and she can't find the key
An alto is just a soprano that can sight read
@MollySuzanne96 @MichaelaMellmer I have a dream of this every night and wake up to discover that this is reality
@scoutvinson People will be so mad about that 😂
@scoutvinson That's true....
@noah0_0purcell Lies

@scoutvinson I can either pick it or gave the staff do it...what do you think I should do?
@scoutvinson Ehh....can we not tho 😅
@scoutvinson Good question. I hate sweet potatoes of all kinds except fries, but I only tolerate the fries. Also have disdain for artichoke
Single guys, ever look at yourself in the mirror and realize you need a female to take care of you eyebrows for you? No? Just me? K then 😂
@KarissaBurright @scoutvinson I'm sure everyone will out of habit anyways, it's hard to change a name so iconic as Bad Wolf
@KarissaBurright @scoutvinson Some would say my camp name sounded sketchy. But Sketchy was an ok camp name. Funny how that works eh? 😂
@KarissaBurright @scoutvinson Indeed they are. Tragic event in history but necessary as well

@zpaulphog I went with the financial crisis for the combination of economics and history
@zpaulphog You're on a role, keep it up
@therealajar Same
Quick y'all, this is important. What's the most important historical thing that's happened in the last 10 years?
@MichaelaMellmer See that's funny cuz it's actually me
At the end of the day all I want is someone to quote "Scott Sterling" videos with #StudioC

If y'all need a good devotional to go through, Holy Emotions on the Bible app is a freaking great one.
@natclark97 I'm a man of my word 🤷🏻‍♂️
Prolly the same place your jokes come from 😵😵😵 
@MichaelaMellmer The dedicated few are still on a quest to catch em all
@natclark97 Super sorry....I hardcore passed out
@MichaelaMellmer @scoutvinson @taybuss28 @rachaelwhearn @zpaulphog Omg yes. I'll sell black beanies that say wolfie on them as a joke to how I got my name in the first place
@MichaelaMellmer @scoutvinson @taybuss28 @rachaelwhearn @zpaulphog "Wolfie or nothing" has the potential to be a campaign slogan
K it's getting official here
@therealajar @scoutvinson This actually made me cry
@scoutvinson 5 of them have...
@therealajar it was given to my by a fifth grade teacher so that her student would stop using it I swear 😭

@scoutvinson @taybuss28 @MichaelaMellmer @rachaelwhearn @zpaulphog my marine buddy wants my name to Soap
@therealajar @scoutvinson Naw. Don't have any time 🤷🏻‍♂️
@therealajar @scoutvinson I'm not into pop culture. I can tell you everything about worship, but I can't tell you the first thing about any celebrity
@scoutvinson Dang. Yeah I mean maybe
@scoutvinson No......
@scoutvinson Wait what does this even mean 😂
Potential winner.... 
@scoutvinson Buttercup calls me that lol
@EmilySestak27 @rhettmc What does he even mean 😂😂 I wasn't aware that sleeping n decorative pillows is frowned upon
@Katie_Tolbert14 @j2wagar It's not even peer pressure at this point, it's legitimately something that I need to change 😭
@therealajar Same
@therealajar If you don't know what it means then it can sound pretty "Sketchy" (pun intended)
@Katie_Tolbert14 @j2wagar I could rock Why tbh
@Katie_Tolbert14 @j2wagar It literally is tho
@rachaelwhearn I would honestly do that just to make him mad but I hate that name 😂😭
@therealajar Camp has gotten complaints about my name before and I'm getting lots of stage time this summer, so they wanna avoid any problems this year
@j2wagar Long story 😭
@MollySuzanne96 @MichaelaMellmer He looks proud
@j2wagar I have to change it 😓

Drill instructors, MREs, PFTs, CFTs, obstacle courses, fire watches, and desperate need for laxatives are pretty much how my weekend went.
@MarvinBoomin Ye
Just remembered a song I never finished writing called "Dear Future Someone"...I should finish it

Is it bad that I look down and am surprised that my socks are matching?
Enjoying a well earned Grizzly long-cut dip before bed tonight. So wiped out

@thatkidAndie Being a male, what prolly happened was they wanted to compliment you like a normal human but got too nervous and settled for "proportionate"
@LorettaAnnHoeff Same

Doing Greek homework, watching war movies and eating cream cheese. Is this the point my life has culminated to?

#NewProfilePic 
Slept all day, time to make up for it with a run to the gym, a killer workout, and then a run back.
The sky is clear, the air is warm...I know this is too good to last 😫
When you nap from 5-9 and existence doesn't even compute in your mind anymore 😴😴
@MichaelaMellmer The world may never know 👀
I wake up to "The Feel Good Drag" everymorninf, and it's awesome
When you just go through your day and realize that you haven't eaten and it's 9pm

@MatPatGT you should do a theory on #Outlast2, there's so much to unpack
Prom sucked, I'm single, I was evicted into a closet, but Jesus is in charge so I'm good. I've got the Bible and #Outlast2 to entertain me
@MichaelaMellmer they don't stop coming 😂 
Readjusting again to having people living in my house who aren't family. Usually just means getting comfy with cramped rooms and such
Not sure what more I can do

“The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.”
Psalms 34:18 ESV

(3) worship.
(2) with the Son of God ought to cause an expression of worship that goes beyond ... way beyond ... the official structure of acceptable
(1) When confronted with the Kingship of Jesus Christ, many of us hold back and refuse to change our style of worship. A genuine experience
Never miss an opportunity to tell someone that you love them.…
